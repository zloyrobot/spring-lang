        comment  EULER COMPUTES THE SUM OF FCT(I) FOR I FROM ZERO UP TO
        INFINITY BY MEANS OF A SUITABLY REFINED EULER TRANSFORMATION. THE
        SUMMATION IS STOPPED AS SOON AS TIM TIMES IN SUCCESSION THE ABSOLUTE
        VALUE OF THE TERMS OF THE TRANSFORMED SERIES ARE FOUND TO BE LESS THAN
        EPS. HENCE, ONE SHOULD PROVIDE A FUNCTION FCT WITH ONE INTEGER ARGUMENT,
        AN UPPER BOUND EPS, AND AN INTEGER TIM. THE OUTPUT IS THE SUM SUM. EULER
        IS PARTICULARLY EFFICIENT IN THE CASE OF A SLOWLY CONVERGENT OR
        DIVERGENT ALTERNATING SERIES;
